# PTC Creo Configuration Files Language

Provides basic syntax highlighting for configuration files for Creo Parametric (formerly Pro/Engineer) and Creo Simulate.

Still at its early steps, feel free to add your thoughts.

## Notes

The package currently supports lines that begin with `#` as comments.

Be aware that Creo mostly needs configuration files encoded not in UTF-8 but in ANSI.

## How to install

Open Atom and go to `File` → `Settings` → `Install`  and search for **language-ptc-pro**, then press `Install` on the right.
